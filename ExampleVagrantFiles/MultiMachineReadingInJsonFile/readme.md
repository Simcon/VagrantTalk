##Multiple Machines

This vagrant file reads from a nodes.json files and creates multiples virtual machines.  

This is a much cleaner way for simple multiple machines to be configured and does not duplicate the configurations over and over for each machine.

To create the virtual machine run "vagrant up" in this directory.
