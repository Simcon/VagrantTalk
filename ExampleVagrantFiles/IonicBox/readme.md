##Linux Machine to use for Ionic development

This machine will use a linux machine that has everything already configured for developing for the Ionic framework, [http://ionicframework.com](http://ionicframework.com).

If you are running this machine on Windows, you will need to run the command prompt that you are start up the Vagrant machine with as an administrator for everything to work correctly.

Full details for using the Ionic box are available at [digitaldrummerj.me/ionicbox-notes/](digitaldrummerj.me/ionicbox-notes/)


To create the virtual machine run "vagrant up" in this directory.
